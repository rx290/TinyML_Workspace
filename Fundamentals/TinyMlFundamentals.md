## What is TinyML?

    TinyML is a field that is a cross between machine learning and embedded systems.
    It is a field that revolves around taking tiny computing devices and enabling machine learning smarts.

    official definition:
        Tiny Machine Learning is a **fast growing field of Machine Learning** technologies and applications including **algorithms, hardware and software** capable of performing **on-device sensor data analytics** (Vision,audio,IMU,biomedical,etc.) at **extremely low power**, typically in the MiliWatt range and below, and here enabling a variety of **always-on-use-cases** and targeting **battery-operated device**.

## Why it is used?

    It is used to enable machine learning on embedded devices.

## How it is used?

    Ok Google, Siri, Alexa and so on uses a technique called **keyword spotting** or **hotword detection**.

### What is an embedded system?

    An embedded system is a computing device that is quite small, or tiny and operated on low power or extremely low powers.
    Which means these compact size devices can run for days, weeks, month and sometimes even years on something like a coin battery.

### What is Machine Learning?

    A subfield of AI that uses a lot of data to infer interesting patterns about new data that's unknown to it.
